# File Uploader by Uploadcare

This repo holds stuff that drives Uploadcare Widget experience
into [JotForm](https://jotform.com/). In order to discover
the widget in `JotForm Widgets`, search for
[File Uploader by Uploadcare](https://widgets.jotform.com/widget/file_uploader_by_uploadcare).

On top of that, there's that great
[tutorial](https://uploadcare.com/tutorials/jotform/)
dedicated to integrating our File Uploader into a web form built with
JotForm.

## Requirements

In order to use File Uploader by Uploadcare with JotForm:

* You got to be registered with both Uploadcare and JotForm.
* There should be at least one Uploadcare project set up.
	This is needed to have a `public_key` associated with a project.
* At least a single web form should be present in your JotForm account.
	You'll need that form to add our File Uploader to it.

## Installation

Please, refer to the [tutorial](https://uploadcare.com/tutorials/jotform/)
for most of the issues regarding:

* Uploadcare and JotForm integration.
* Using and configuring our File Uploader.

More info about Uploadcare Widget itself
can be found in our
[documentation](https://uploadcare.com/documentation/widget/).
